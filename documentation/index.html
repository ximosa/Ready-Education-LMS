							<p>Educator is a simple learning management system plugin for WordPress. It lets you sell and teach courses online.</p>
							<p>1. A student finds a course and clicks “Register”. She/he fills in the course registration form, selects a payment method, and clicks “Continue”.</p>
							<p>2. Verify the payment. If the payment method can be verified automatically (e.g., PayPal and Stripe), the payment is approved immediately in most cases. However, if the student decides to pay with a payment method, which should be verified manually (e.g., bank transfer, cash, and check), you’ll have to verify the payment manually.</p>
							<p>The outcome of the successful payment verification is the course <b>entry</b> for the student. This entry has its <b>Status</b> set to <b>In Progress</b>.</p>
							<p>3. Now, the student can start studying. She/he can read lessons and take quizzes within the chosen course. You can check the quizzes and grade them.</p>
							<p>4. The student has to complete the course at some point. To indicate that the student has finished the course, you should edit his/her entry, set the Grade and change the Status to Completed.</p>

							<h3>Setup Taxes</h3>
							<p>Please test your taxes configuration carefully.</p>
							<p>Please go to Educator > Settings > Taxes and edit the following settings:</p>

							<p><b>Enable Taxes</b></p>
							<p>This setting enables taxes feature and tells educator to calculate taxes on purchases. The taxes have to be configured.</p>

							<p><b>Prices Entered With Tax</b></p>
							<p>Whether you enter prices inclusive or exclusive of tax.</p>
							<p>Inclusive taxes apply to your selling location (set it on the Educator > Settings screen). For example, if your selling location is Canada, Alberta and you have a tax rate defined for it (e.g. Canada, Alberta 10% or Canada 10%), this tax rate will be included in the prices you enter. If you set the price to $11 for a course and you add a 10% tax rate for your selling location, then, $1 tax will be included in this price, such that the price break down that users see on the payment page should be $10 subtotal, $1 tax, and $11 total, if the billing country and state selected by the student match your selling location’s country and state, otherwise, the total price will be calculated excluding tax (e.g., if a student selects his/her billing address’ state or country different to your selling location).</p>

							<p><b>Tax Classes</b></p>
							<p>In different countries the tax rates are applied differently, they may be split into a number of categories (or tax classes). Each tax class may be applied to a different category of products and services. Tax classes can have different tax rates. Based on your country, you can use just the default tax class or create multiple tax classes and setup different your tax rates per class.</p>
							<p>Once you setup your tax classes and rates you need to assign these tax classes to your courses and/or memberships. Edit a course or a membership and select the relevant tax class from the Tax Class select box.</p>

							<p><b>Tax Class Rates</b></p>
							<p>You can add multiple rates per tax class. Every rate has the following attributes:</p>
							<p>1. <b>Country:</b> The rate will be applied based on the customer’s billing country.</p>
							<p>2. <b>State:</b> The rate will be applied based on the customer’s billing country and billing state.</p>
							<p>3. <b>Name:</b> The tax rate name (for example, VAT (19%)).</p>
							<p>4. <b>Rate (%):</b> The tax rate, given in percentage (from 0 to 100). Examples: 10, 20, 19.5, etc.</p>
							<p>5. <b>Priority:</b> Define how the tax rates are to be grouped. Only the first matching tax rate will be selected per priority group. Priority should be entered as a positive integer (0 or greater). The rates are applied in order of their priority (in ascending order).</p>

							<h3>Setup Memberships</h3>
							<p>This page has only one setting at the time of this writing:</p>
							<p>Send an email notification to a user X days before his/her membership expires. Please set this setting to the number of days (e.g., 7)</p>
						</div>

						<div class="section-txt">
							<h3>Setup Email Settings</h3>
							<p>Currently, there are 4 types of email notifications in Educator:</p>
							<p>1. <b>Student registered:</b> A student receives this email when he/she registers for a course</p>
							<p>2. <b>Quiz grade:</b> A student receives this email when he/she receives a grade for a quiz</p>
							<p>3. <b>Membership registration:</b> A student receives this email when he/she registers for a membership</p>
							<p>4. <b>Membership renew:</b> A student receives this email when his/her membership expires soon</p>
							<p>Each email template has a number of placeholders available (e.g., {student_name}, {course_title}, etc). These placeholders are replaced with the real values when an email is being sent.</p>
							<p><b>Important note:</b> If payment can not be identified automatically ( for example paypal payment can be identified automatically after payment), then email for course registration is sent only after you set payment status to "completed" and enable checkbox for "create entry for this user" via wp admin panel > educator > payments >edit pending payment.</p>
							<p>For membership payments email is sending only after you set payment status to "completed" and enable checkbox "Setup membership for this student". If you will not enable that checkbox and not set payment status to "completed" then user will not be assigned to course / membership and email will not be sent.</p>

							<h3>Add Educator’s Pages to the Menu</h3>
							<p>It is quite easy to add the pages like Payment or My Courses to the menu, but it is not straight forward how to add the courses archive page.</p>

							<p>1. Go to Apparance » Customize » Menus</p>
							<p>2. Select your menu and click Add Items</p>

							<h3>Protect Private Uploads</h3>
							<p>It is important to prevent private uploads from being served to anyone on the Internet. Learn how to protect the Educator’s private uploads directory.</p>
							<p><b>Examples of private uploads:</b></p>
							<p>A user uploads a file to answer a quiz question of type “File Upload”.</p>
							<p>By default, Educator stores private uploads in the following directory: path/to/your/website/wp-content/uploads/edr. This directory can be changed by the use of the edr_private_uploads_dir filter hook.</p>
							<p>The way to protect the private uploads directory depends on the web server software your website is being served by.</p>
							<p>By default, Educator attempts to protect the private uploads directory using an .htaccess file. However, this kind of protection works only if your website is served by the Apache web server. The .htaccess file contents look like this:</p>
<pre>Options -Indexes
deny from all</pre>
							<p>The <b>nginx</b> users have to setup a proper <b>Location context</b> to protect this directory. You could use the following example to setup your own Location context to protect your private uploads:
<pre>location ~ ^/wp-content/uploads/edr/ {
  deny all;
  return 403;
}</pre>
							<p>You have to add the Location context in the right place inside the server block of your website.</p>
							<p>The other way to protect this directory is to move it outside of your web server’s document root. You can use the <i>edr_private_uploads_dir</i> filter hook to accomplish this.</p>
							<p>Independent of the web server you are using, you should make sure that your private upload directory is protected and you cannot access any file from that directory by using a URL like: <i>http://your-website.com/wp-content/uploads/edr/path/to/a/file (e.g., http://your-website.com/wp-content/uploads/edr/quiz/5c/e2/5ce2807497444addd248e8cd9b17712302119c90.txt).</i></p>
						</div>

							<h3>For Developers: Add a custom currency</h3>
							<p>You can use the edr_currencies filter to add a custom currency. You can use the code example below to add your currency:</p>
<pre>function myprefix_add_currency( $currencies ) {
  $currencies['AUD'] = 'Australian Dollar';
  return $currencies;
}
add_filter( 'edr_currency', 'myprefix_add_currency' );</pre>
    						<p>The child theme’s functions.php can be a good place to add this piece code.</p>
    						<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
    						<p>1. Please use the standard currency code.</p>
    						<p>2. Please make sure that the payment gateways you’re going to use support your currency.</p>
